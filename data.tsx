**Večerní píseň**
Když bylo dobře mamince,
bylo i pěkně v našem bytě.
Hmoždíř, který stal na skříňce,
zatřpytil se okamžitě,
skla oken, po nichž před chvilkou
plakalo ještě bílé jiní,
svítila opět po kuchyni,
kde vonělo to vanilkou.

Když zpívala, hned vesele
spustili ptáci před okny nám.
Měla-li mráček na čele,
odletěli hned ptáci jinam.
Zmlkli jsme rázem, ztichl smích.
I černé kotě, které tlapkou
pohrávalo si se skořápkou,
dívalo se jí po očích.

Když padala již únavou
a večer spát nás odnášela,
tou rukou drsnou od popela
stlala nám měkce pod hlavou.
V hořáku ještě přede plyn
a nad pelestí přechází nám,
podobaje se pavučinám,
velikánský stín maminčin.

Dnes už tak šťastně neusínám.
Replicate the rhyme scheme.
Write a short three stanza poem about spring in Czech. Make sure it rhymes.
Now change the rhyme scheme to ABAB.

Answers:
1. Who runs the magazine which is at the centre of the story, who named it and who owns it.
		Mr Wilberfloss, Cozy Moments
		Chapter I
		Introduced by: Mr. J. Fillken Wilberfloss, editor-in-chief of _Cosy Moments_, was about to leave his post and start on a ten weeks' holiday.
		_Cosy Moments_, as its name (an inspiration of Mr. Wilberfloss's own) is designed to imply, is a journal for the home.
		
		It was founded by its proprietor, Mr. Benjamin White, as an antidote to yellow journalism.
		
2. Who is the second character from Wyoming and what does he do?
		Chapter IX
		"That was Kid Brady."
		
		"The name is unfamiliar to me. Another contributor?"
		
		"He's from my part of the country—Wyoming. He wants to fight any one in the world at a hundred and thirty-three pounds."

3. Who is a prominent cat lover in the story? 
		Chapter IV
		"Guess I know where dat kitty belongs. Dey all have dose collars. I guess she's one of Bat Jarvis's kitties. He's got a lot of dem for fair, and every one wit one of dem collars round deir neck."
		
		"Who's Bat Jarvis? Do you mean the gang-leader?"
		
		"Sure. He's a cousin of mine," said Master Maloney with pride.
		
		"Is he?" said Billy. "Nice sort of fellow to have in the family. So you think that's his cat?"
		
4. What happens at the end of chapter 25?

		They went out into the street, Psmith thoughtful and hardly realising the other's presence. By the side of the pavement a few yards down the road a taximeter-cab was standing. Psmith hailed it.
		
		Mr. Parker was still beside him. It occurred to Psmith that it would not do to let him hear the address Billy Windsor had given in his note.
		
		"Turn and go on down the street," he said to the driver.
		
		He had taken his seat and was closing the door, when it was snatched from his grasp and Mr. Parker darted on to the seat opposite. The next moment the cab had started up the street instead of down and the hard muzzle of a revolver was pressing against Psmith's waistcoat.
		
		"Now what?" said Mr. Parker smoothly, leaning back with the pistol resting easily on his knee.
		
5. What were the pleasantries the main character and the owner of the tenements exchanged when the latter came in? Replicate the exchange word for word until the point the introductions are concluded.

	Psmith had risen to greet him.
	
	"Won't you sit down?" he said.
	
	"I prefer to stand."
	
	"Just as you wish. This is Liberty Hall."
	
	Mr. Waring again glanced at Mr. Wilberfloss.
	
	"What I have to say is private," he said.
	
	"All is well," said Psmith reassuringly. "It is no stranger that you see before you, no mere irresponsible lounger who has butted in by chance. That is Comrade J. Fillken Wilberfloss, the editor of this journal."
	
	"The editor? I understood—"
	
	"I know what you would say. You have Comrade Windsor in your mind. He was merely acting as editor while the chief was away hunting sand-eels in the jungles of Texas. In his absence Comrade Windsor and I did our best to keep the old journal booming along, but it lacked the master-hand. But now all is well: Comrade Wilberfloss is once more doing stunts at the old stand. You may speak as freely before him as you would before well, let us say Comrade Parker."
	
	"Who are you, then, if this gentleman is the editor?"
	
	"I am the proprietor."
	
	"I understood that a Mr. White was the proprietor."
	
	"Not so," said Psmith. "There was a time when that was the case, but not now. Things move so swiftly in New York journalistic matters that a man may well be excused for not keeping abreast of the times, especially one who, like yourself, is interested in politics and house-ownership rather than in literature. Are you sure you won't sit down?"

    searchContent: `Make a list of Oxford museums and galleries that are within 10-15 minute walking distance of Jesus College for conference attendees. Create a table with opening times, description and a link to a google maps with walking directions from Jesus College.
What are the effects of culture shock on international students' experience of their studies and in particular learning outcomes? Are there any differences between the source and target cultures? What cultures have been most studied and what dimensions of culture have been addressed?
There is no one right way to answer it but an expert in the field can review the results and see whether they are broadly consonant with what is known.
We can evaluate the choice of sources - research vs shallow guidance vs personal accounts.
Create a list of open language models I can run on a Mac today. Which ones would be best for which configuration and how to best run them. I'm thinking about what is the best I can do for budgets from £500 to £10,000. Which models should I choose for different configurations and what sort of things can I do with them
The correct answer will vary with time but the judgement of quality`,
